# Alchemy's Week 4 Project: Hardhat Unit Testing

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. The main objective of this assignment was to practice writing unit tests for a contract's functions.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
